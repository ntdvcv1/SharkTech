# SharkTech Promo Codes and Latest SharkTech DDoS Protection Deals for 2026

## SharkTech Introduction

Founded in 2003, SharkTech has built a solid reputation as a pioneer in DDoS-protected hosting, cloud, and colocation services. Headquartered in Las Vegas, Nevada, this veteran provider has been serving a global clientele for over two decades with one clear mission: combining reliable infrastructure with unmatched support to empower businesses, developers, and IT professionals.

What sets SharkTech apart? It's their specialty in DDoS protection. While most hosting providers treat DDoS mitigation as an afterthought, SharkTech built their entire network assuming attacks would happen. Every service includes their proprietary DDoS protection solution that monitors networks and instantly filters common attacks up to 60Gbps (scalable to 1Tbps). This isn't just marketing talk—gaming communities, financial services, and SaaS platforms trust SharkTech to keep their operations online when others go dark.

The company operates five strategically located data centers across Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Denver, Chicago, and Amsterdam. Each facility features enterprise-grade infrastructure with redundant power, cooling, and 40G/100G network connectivity. Whether you need a single VPS for $7.95/month or a complex private cloud deployment, SharkTech's team of experts provides 24/7 support through live chat, phone, email, and tickets—real people, not chatbots.

SharkTech's product lineup covers virtually every hosting need. Their Smart VPS plans start incredibly affordable while delivering NVMe-backed performance across multiple regions. Bare-metal dedicated servers offer full hardware-level access with customizable configurations. For organizations needing cloud flexibility, their OpenStack-powered Public Cloud and Dedicated Cloud solutions provide scalable, vendor-lock-free environments at prices guaranteed to be at least 20% less than major hyperscalers like AWS or Azure.
